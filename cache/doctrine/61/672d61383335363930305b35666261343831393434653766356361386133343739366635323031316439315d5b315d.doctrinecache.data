<p><strong>EPESI</strong> is an application that uses a sophisticated database to store many types of records, like:</p>
<ul>
<li>Companies</li>
<li>Contacts</li>
<li>Calendar Events</li>
<li>To Do Lists</li>
<li>Phone Calls</li>
<li>Notes</li>
</ul>
<p>It is a multiuser, real-time collaboration software that allows linking of records to employees and customers. All data and application scripts are kept on the web server. We designed this application in such a way that once information is stored it remains there forever. Even deleted records are kept as hidden from users' view but never deleted from the database.</p>
<p><strong>EPESI</strong> is offered as <strong>FREE</strong> and Open Source software. It has a modular architecture and the functionality can be extended with additional modules. All modules are written using the <strong>EPESI</strong> framework.</p>";s:12:"content_meta";N;}
