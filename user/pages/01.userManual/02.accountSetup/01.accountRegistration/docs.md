In order to be able to use the EPESI Store you first need to **register** your installation and obtain a License Key. All your purchases will be bound to this installation and License Key and at any time there can be only one installation running with the specific License Key.


Some premium modules are available for **free**, but in order to use them you still need to obtain a license for them through the Store.

Once you obtain the license you are eligible for all the future updates of the module without any additional payments. Also, any changes in prices will not affect any of the modules you already have license for.
___

You can display your license key by choosing this option in the top panel.
