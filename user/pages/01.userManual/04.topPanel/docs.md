####Action Bar
___

Action Bar is an area where the module displays **buttons** to perform different operations, like editing, saving, deleting or creating new records, accessing different modules, etc. As in any database application a user can perform the following basic functions on records (called **CRUD**):
	* **C**reate
	* **R**ead
	* **U**pdate
	* **D**elete

We enhanced this functionality by adding ability to **Clone** the record and preserving entire **editing history**, plus as we noted earlier - no record is permanently deleted and can be restored at any time by administrator.

The Action Bar changes depending on the module you are in. This action bar shown above is a default one for a Dashboard.

####Launchpad
___

The **launchpad button** opens Launchpad which is a quick way to open a particular module. The Launchpad can be customized by the user. Menu shows always all modules accessible to the user. The Launchpad can show only frequently used modules.

####Global Search and Filter Box

######Login Indicator

![Login Indicator](/images/login_indicator.png) 

######Logout Button

![Logout Button](/images/logout_button.png) **logout** from the application. Normally you can just **close the browser**. If you click on Logout button the cookie stored by your browser will be deleted and opening the application next time will require the user to login again by providing username and password. It removes the cookie stored by "Remember me" option from the login screen. Logout button should be used when using a public computer to prevent someone else from accessing your data.

######Global Search

![Global Search](/images/global_search.png) This is a global search option. The search engine will try to find a word or a phrase in all records: Contacts, Companies, Notes, etc.

######Perspective

![Perspective Button](/images/perspective_button.png) Some modules use this feature to filter records that belong to a particular user. When it is gray it means that it is inactive. Please see the section about CRM Filters for more details.
