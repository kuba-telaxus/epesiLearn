EPESI CRM offers basic mobile interface which works on Android and iPhone smartphones. It was built on top of an old version of UiUIKit (Universal iPhone UI Kit) https://code.google.com/p/iphone-universal/

This interface is rudimentary and does not offer all features of the full blown "desktop" client, but allows the user to view and edit records.

When using a smartphone or a tablet a user can still choose to use the "dektop" or "mobile" interface:
