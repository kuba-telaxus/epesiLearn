####Agenda

Agenda puts events in a list, one under another. It gives you the possibility to view events in a few useful orders, for example chronologically.

2. This button serves as a filter for event types. Clicking it will let you choose whether to display Meetings, Task and Phonecalls.


3. This bar, apart from obvious informational usage, serves as the sorting tool. All fields here, except "Actions", work as sorting buttons. When you click them, you choose the value by which the events are sorted and also toggle ascending/descending order.


4. These buttons serve as shortcuts to the common actions you might want to perform on the events.

####Event Frame

In the Month view the size is fixed. You can see here some basic information, like the starting time of the event and usually shortened version of event's title. There is a small icon 
<span class="fa-stack">
  <i class="fa fa-square-o fa-stack-2x"></i>
  <i class="fa fa-info fa-stack-1x"></i>
</span>
 in the top left corner of the frame. When you hover mouse over it, details of the event will be displayed. When you click on this icon, then menu with actions will be displayed.
