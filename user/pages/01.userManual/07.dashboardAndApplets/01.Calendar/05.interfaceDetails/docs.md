####Deletion Area
___

![Deletion Area](/images/calendar_deletion_area.png)

This area, marked with the icon of dust bin, serves as a simple method of deleting events. It is used in all views with event frames: Day view, Week view and Month view. To delete particular event, just drag and drop event frame on this spot.

####Time Panel
___

This panel contains labels that indicate the time of the day which is represented by the cells next to them. It is used in Day view and Week view. There are several types of labels here, each of them should be interpreted in a slightly different manner.

![Time Panel](/images/calendar_time_panel.png)

1. This label marks that events in the same row are "timeless". This means that there is not specific time of their start and end. It appears only once for one time panel, always on top of it.
2. This label, which is always right after "Timeless", marks the row that contains all the events that happen before the "start of the day". The time of this start may be changed in Options. There is always only one such label for a time panel. It is placed between "timeless" label and the standard ones.
3. This is typical label of time panel. All of them have the same time span. Here it is one hour, but this can be changed to different values in Options. The duration of the event might be, of course, longer than the duration of one of such labels. Event frame is then situated in more than one cell.
4. This label is next to the row, which contains all the events that happen after the "end of the day". Exact time of this "end" can be set in Options. This label is always at the end of time panel. There could be only one such label in one time panel.
