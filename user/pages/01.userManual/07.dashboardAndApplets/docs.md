It contains 3 columns with smaller sections called applets. Applets are small frames that display information or work as simple applications. They are often linked with epesi modules. You can arrange them in any order you wish. To do this, click on applet's title bar and simply drag and drop it at the chosen location. You can also remove and add new ones.

To add a new applet, click on the "Config" button located in the Action Bar. Next, choose the type of the applet from the list and, if the chosen applet requires it, set applet's options. You may have more than one applet of each type on your Dashboard, all of them with individual settings. For example one instance of an applet Tasks will show your "new" tasks and other those "in progress".

####Applets
___
Applets differ from each other in many ways. They have specific options, columns, buttons etc. However, there are a few common interface tools that can be used in any applet.

-**Fullscreen** button - redirects you to the contents of module, whith which the applet is connected. If applet isn't connected with any module, this button won't be shown.

-**Remove** button - removes the applet from the dashboard. It doesn't remove any data that may be viewed with the applet. However you should remember that with the removal, all options you chose about particular applet are erased.
