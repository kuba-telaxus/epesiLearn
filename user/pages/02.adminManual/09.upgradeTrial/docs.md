Upgrading your installation from trial to hosting plan is simple - all you have to do is registering and making first payment for hosting. You can do this at any time of your trial - you will still be able to use all the days that have left from your free trial. You can also upgrade your installation after your free trial has expired - you have 30 days for that.

To **register your installation** click Register button in either hosting management applet (on Dashboard) or module (Menu -> Administrator -> Hosting Management).

To **make a payment**, follow instructions below:

####Step 1 - Access Payment Manager
___

First thing to do is to access the payments management page. Depending on the status of your trial you can do it either by applet, administrator panel (when your trial is still active) or by e-mail (when your trial has expired).

   1. First option is to click **Extend service button** on **Hosting Management applet** on Dashboard.

   3. The third option shall be used if your trial is already inactive. When you try to enter your epesi installation, you will see a page informing about your trial expiration. Click on the link there to receive a hosting management e-mail. The e-mail will be sent to the **e-mail address used when your hosting installation was created**.

   In the e-mail you will find several links that allow you to manage your epesi installation. In order to access payments management choose the link that lets you **extend the service**. (Note: the exact look of the e-mail may vary depending on the e-mail client you are using.)
