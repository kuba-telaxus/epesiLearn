Admin tools are helper scripts to allow run some administrative procedures like running patches, updating theme and several other. Sometimes they are called **/admin** tools, because they are located under _/admin_ subdirectory of EPESI installation.

To access those tools you should open **http[s]://<your EPESI url>/admin/** and log as super administrator.
